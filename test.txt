abstract="This study presents a comprehensive overview of the approaches employed in recommendation systems over the last decade. The review primarily draws from two categories of filtering techniques: content-based filtering and collaborative filtering methods. We have reviewed and tabulated approximately forty articles that have been published. Major findings include: (1) collaborative filtering is more often used than content-based filtering, 70{\%} to 23{\%}, the rest is hybrid methods of these two; (2) more than half of the machine learning approaches adopted are supervised learning; however, (3) algorithm-wise, K-means the unsupervised learning algorithm emerged as the most frequently adopted approach in recommendation systems. Also notably, cosine similarity stands out as the prevalent measurement technique.",

Due to the wide range of products offered by retailers, recommendation systems provide an optimal approach for displaying only relevant products to customers by forming associations that exist between products. Still, it is also important to understand the characteristics of customers connected to different product associations. Conventional approaches for product recommendation systems apply association algorithms and unsupervised classification of customers based on product ratings. However, it is not clear what demographic properties of customers are linked to which different product associations. This paper applies a hybrid system of machine learning (ML) association and clustering algorithms to implement a product recommendation system that shows associations that exist in products and unique customer profiles linked to these associations. The method described in this paper is evaluated with a case of a hygiene product retailer in Austria.}

abstract = {The rapid expansion of information resources on the internet has made it increasingly challenging for users to get valuable and relevant information. Recommendation systems (RSs) play a vital role in addressing this issue by providing personalized suggestions based on user preferences. However, the open nature of RSs allows for the injection of fake profiles by malicious users, leading to biased ratings and manipulation of the overall system results. These fake profiles have been intended to promote or degrade specific items, which creates bias in the system and compromises the user experience. The motivation behind these fake profiles is to promote or degrade a particular item, which affects the system and makes it more biased toward certain items. This research paper aims to detect and eliminate such fake profiles in RSs, ensuring users receive genuine and reliable results. The proposed approach utilizes a voting ensemble (VE) method, combining the strengths of multiple classification algorithms including Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA), K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), and Naive Bayes classifier (NBC). By utilizing these classifiers, the system enhances its robustness against malicious activities. The proposed VE method effectively identifies the fake profiles with a minimum number of parameters, and it shows high detection accuracy on Movielens datasets. It has been demonstrated that the proposed method gives 99.4%, 99.5%, 99.4% and 99.6% accuracy using NBC, QDA, KNN, and VE, respectively and it outperforms all other competing methods in terms of accuracy, precision, recall and MCC.}

However, finding a movie from the numerous options available in a movie database to suit a user's taste is a non-trivial task. Most recommendation systems do not consider the user's limitations, such as whether the user has the means to watch the movie suggested by the system. This paper proposes a system to provide recommendations that are platform specific. Two sources of movies have been considered, viz., Netflix and Amazon Prime, and other data sets can be included as well. In addition to providing recommendations, the proposed system helps filter movies based on user-specified criteria. It applies big data analytics for faster execution of both movie recommendation and data filtering and can work with large and distributed movie databases.}

abstract = {To alleviate the big data difficulties that have created a potential problem for many Internet users, it is necessary to filter, rank, and efficiently communicate the relevant information on the Web, where the diversity of possibilities is overwhelming. Recommender systems, which sift through enormous amounts of dynamically generated data to give consumers with personalised information and services, are able to overcome this problem. Bipartite graphs are currently generally used to store and understand this data due to its sparse nature. Data are mapped to a bipartite user-item interaction network where the graph topology captures detailed information about user-item associations, transforming a recommendation issue into a link prediction problem. Earlier, approaches for link prediction in bipartite graphs for various recommendation systems were developed, but the efficacy of the prediction methodology was not close to the standards required by real-time recommenders. So, the primary goal of this research is to offer an effective link prediction-based recommendation system that takes advantage of SVD++ along with K-nearest neighbors and reduces the system's error rate, leading to better outcomes. The proposed system is sorely tested on the MovieLens dataset and compared to some traditional recommendation methods. The results demonstrate that the suggested strategy exceeds all traditional approaches in terms of accuracy, and the actual suggestions are equally encouraging.}

In this regard, a systematic review of the recommender system's mechanisms which have been used in cloud computing was conducted. We classified the cloud recommender system's mechanisms into four main categories: collaborative filtering, demographic-based, knowledge-based and hybrid. Moreover, this study represented a systematic review and comparison of the above-mentioned techniques in terms of scalability, availability, accuracy, and trust attributes. The results of the present review revealed that previous studies contributed scalability and accuracy to the recommender system, but the contribution of the trust and security improvement has not been considerable well.}

In the digital landscape publishers need to optimize their editorial strategies to increase reader engagement and digital revenue. Newsletters emerged as an important conversion channel to engage readers as they provide a personalized experience by building habits. However, the lack of human resources and the need for more content assertiveness per reader lead publishers to search for an advanced analytics solution. We address this problem by proposing a research agenda on news recommendation algorithms inspired in the table d’hôte approach and the concept of ‘personalized diversity’. Thus, the reader receives a personalized newsletter where he can discover informative and surprising content. The goal is to offer a self-contained package that retains readers, increases loyalty and consequently, the propensity to subscribe. A live controlled experiment with readers from the Portuguese newspaper Público was performed and a new approach is proposed. We study the effects of content recommendations on the behavior of newsletter subscribers. Findings reveal that serendipitous content tends to increase reader engagement. Finally, we propose a table d’hôte approach and new challenges are identified for future research.}

Under such circumstances, we proposed a novel recommendation algorithm joined session-based context-aware recommendation model. The model maps contextual information into low-dimensional real vector features and then fuses them into a recurrent neural network recommendation model based on sessions by three combinations of Add, Stack, and Multilayer Perceptron. We have verified its extensibility by combining it with the functional extension module which rest on long sequences. We conducted extensive experiments on two public datasets. The experimental results show that our model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art recommendation models in terms of recommendation performance.}

Most of the existing context-aware recommender systems (CARS) build recommendation models considering context as a static entity. In practice, user preferences are dynamic and change over time. In this study, we argue that CARS must be able to dynamically opt for the evolving behavior of contextual attributes. We propose a solution with a runtime identification of contextual information and jointly integrate content analysis to boost recommendation performance. Initially, the proposed model constructs a list of contextually similar candidates. The users’ context information extracted in the initial step is modeled together with the content information to estimate a context score used to find contextually reliable neighbors. Instead of relying on a fixed rating matrix, we dynamically exploit contextual information for effective rating prediction. Experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms classical and state-of-the-art recommendation algorithms.}

The matrix factorization (MF) technique is one of the main methods among collaborative filtering (CF) techniques that have been widely used after the Netflix competition. Traditional MF techniques are static in nature. However, the perception and popularity of products are constantly changing with time. Similarly, the users’ tastes are changed with time. Hence, traditional MF cannot handle the dynamic effect of the user-item interaction. To tackle the temporal and dynamic effect of user-item interaction, we proposed a collaborative filtering model for movie recommendations that include temporal effects. To justify the significance of the proposed technique, we evaluated our model on a standard dataset (Movielens) and compared it with state-of-art models. The exploratory outcomes signify that the proposed technique obtains a better result than a state-of-art model with an improvement of 1.35% and 1.28% on ML-100K and 1M datasets, respectively.}

Determining a recommended trust path based on the consumer’s non-functional requirements, such as availability of the products, delay for computing recommendations and response time for a good recommendation is one of the challenging issues in online social networks. In this paper, we first design a recommendation-based online social network architecture by incorporating trust information (namely, direct trust and indirect trust), relevance degree and recommended influence value. We propose a high quality of social trust associated model for evaluating a recommended trust path. The proposed model estimates utility values with associated weights based on Shannon entropy information gain. Further, for best recommended trust path selection, we propose a Learning Automata based Recommended Trust Path Selection (LA-RTPS) algorithm to identify multiple recommended trust paths and to determine an aggregate path. The experimentation using real time datasets illustrates the efficacy of the proposed algorithm.}
